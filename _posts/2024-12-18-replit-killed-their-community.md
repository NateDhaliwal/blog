As briefly mentioned in my [first blog post](/NateDhaliwal-s-Blog/2024/12/13/My-First-Post.html), [Replit](https://replit.com) is an online IDE that uses cloud environments. They have a great IDE, and they destroyed their free plan.
<br><br>
They've slowly removed aspects of the community, starting with the ability to run repls (projects) from the Cover Page, then removing the ability to follow other users, and even removing the ability to comment on repls.
<br><br>
Slowly, users left Replit and less junior coders used it. Some users joined Replit Ask (the support forum/community for Replit), but most left. A large portion setup [AMC](https://amcforum.wiki), a community-run forum of users from Replit who left.
<br><br>
A while later, Replit shut down one of their most popular products, Teams for EDU, where teachers could teach coding to their students. No teacher was happy. There were many complaints and pleads to bring it back, some even saying that they would happily pay for it if it were brought back. However, this did not sway Replit's decision and another large chunk of Replit's users left.
<br><br>
Replit pretty much destroyed the remaining users by putting them behind a pay wall, introducing [Replit Core](https://replit.com/replit-core). They killed the free plan by decreasing resources gradually before limiting them to only 3 repls (projects). This was the final straw... NOT! Replit still did one last action that finished off the community entirely.
<br><br>
Replit made the WORST decision EVER. They removed Replit Ask. Yup, the last of Replit's users who were still loyal-ish to Replit. They said that it was too expensive to run. Us Moderators, Junior Moderators and Regulars (Mods, TL4s and TL3s respectively; Replit Ask was a [Discourse](https://discourse.org) forum) said that Replit could self-host the forum for less than $100 (Replit was paying Discourse >$300 on the Business plan with add-ons for storage and pageviews, so it was more than 300 bucks) AND have unlimited staff, pageviews etc. Replit didn't listen. They shut it down anyway. Worse still, because of timezones, I didn't have the chance to say goodbye.
<br><br>
It was such a big setback and disappointment. I'd spent so much time on Ask helping others, replying and posting, and what came out of it? Nothing. Gone, all gone. I was told by a Discourse staff that the database was sent to Replit. AFAIK we didn't receive it. 
<br><br>
Replit didn't care about their community! When a big change was made (e.g. major change of Replit's UI; this was before I was on Ask), Replit didn't consult the community. When a huge topic on the change was made, along with many, many requests to revert it, Replit still didn't do anything and closed the topic.
<br><br>
Apparently they didn't want to have to do with feature requests either. There was a category on Ask called #support:feature-requests. We (TL4s) were told ***not*** to ping Replit Staff on these topics. What? Why bother making this category if you're going to do nothing about it? There were so many feature requests, only a small handful had Replit Staff interacting on them. I would even go as far to say less than 5 topics.
<br><br>
Support was also subpar. The only good, helpful, active Replit Staff was Suzy, and Lena (though she didn't post *that* often). Few staff members were actually replying to support issues. The community were the main ones *really* handling it. Not to discredit Suzy or Lena, though. Or perhaps Ryan. <br>
When I came to [Discourse Meta](https://meta.discourse.org), I saw what an exemplary support team was like. Just about EVERY topic has a Discourse Staff member replying to the OP and helping out. That's the gold standard for support. Replit Ask had none of that. We didn't have access to Replit's backend, so all we could do for some issues were to redirect them to Replit's support email. Discourse, on the other hand, was bustling with Discourse Staff and solutions flying around. That's the role model, as I see it. If only Replit had that kind of support...
<br><br>
Now all that's left are programmers willing to pay $25 a month (or $120 a year). Replit's direction began going towards a more professional route, recently introducing Replit Teams, for enhanced collaboration. Junior coders (who were orginally Replit's target audience) have little place now.
<br><br>
That's the story of how Replit did it. Great job, guys.
