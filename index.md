# Who am I?

I am @NateDhaliwal on Replit and Replit Ask (when it was still around), as well as @natme6677 on Scratch.
<br><br>
I code with Python, HTML, CSS and JS!

# My projects
1. [natedhaliwal - My Python PyPi package](https://pypi.org/project/natedhaliwal/)

# Some facts about me!
  - I only started Python and HTML in 2023, but I'm a fast learner and I completed Replit's [100 Days Of Code](https://replit.com/learn/100-days-of-python/hub?utm_source:widget) course!
  
  - I was an active member of Replit Ask (Replit's support forum), and I was a Jr. Mod (Trust Level 4) on that forum, before it got shut down.

  - I am a huge [Discourse](https://discourse.org) fan. I stumbled upon the Replit Ask, which was powered by Discourse, which then led me to be active on [Discourse Meta](https://meta.discourse.org) after Replit Ask shut down.
