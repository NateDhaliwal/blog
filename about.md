This my blog, where I post random stuff that pops into my head. Some of it is based on personal experiences, and some is about topics that I just want to discuss.

This blog is built using [Jekyll](https://github.com/jekyll/jekyll), a static site generator. The theme is a fork of the Minima theme. You can find the source code for Minima at GitHub [here](https://github.com/jekyll/minima).
